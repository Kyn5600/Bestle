# Project Bestle
## Project Bestle is a Weka based Natural Language Processor (NLP). 
# Instructions:
## Using Eclipse or your IDE of choice, import weka.jar as an external jar/library. In run configurations, the argument "--add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED" is required for the controller program. When running the program, "Base" generates a model and its statistics as well as confusion matrix. Running "Testing" will prompt input, classify that input, and if it does not exist, ask for the classification. This will then be input into the CSV. The CSV location in the code will change per your directory. Running "Bestle", or the main program, will classify the user input and give a corresponding response. The most recent update of the program can be located by checking the commits and finding the most recent version number starting from 1.0.0. 
## Both Testing and Bestle programs have a hidden input of "eval", which will print the statistics and confusion matrix, and "exit", which will exit that program, going back to the controller.
# Future Utilizations
## Possible future utilizations will include various personality types. These will be included for a more personal feel and the possibility of importing the AI to a game or something of the like for NPCs.

## Have fun!
